Just wanted to learn about how to setup production grade logging.  
Using winston library with typescript to setup our logging.  
  
We could use some APM (Application Performance Monitoring) system later (Datadog? Newrelic? Anything...) ðŸ˜‰   

You can run the application in:  

1. Local environment: `npm run start-local`  
2. Production environment: `npm start`
